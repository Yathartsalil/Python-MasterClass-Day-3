# Finding Strings and Substrings
text = "A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that typically consists of a group of related sentences focused on a single idea or topic. It serves to organize thoughts and provide clarity in writing, often marked by indentation at the beginning. While there is no strict rule on the number of sentences in a paragraph, the emphasis should be on the unity and coherence of ideas rather than length. In academic and formal writing, paragraphs help structure essays, research papers, and other documents, making them easier to read and understand"
